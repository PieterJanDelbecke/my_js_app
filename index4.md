## Tests and Submitting

At any time you can run `yarn test` to see your progress. By default it will run in `watch` mode, and you will have to press `q` to quit. It will run the automated tests against your code and let you know what your progress is so far. Once you have all the tests passing, you can submit your challenge. To do this make sure you have committed your work:

1. From the project root `git add .` and add all the files changed in this folder
2. Commit these files to your repository `git commit -m "challenge completed"`
3. Make sure your working tree is clear `git status`
4. Push these files to your github repository (master or main branch) `git push origin master`
5. Log on to Github and visit your fork of this challenge.
6. Make a pull request to the main branch.
7. Wait and watch the final tests run, if you are successful it will automatically let your educators know you are finished.
